# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Summary

### This challenge was for AutosRUs and to analyze their data for the new prototype they have, known as the MechaCar. There were some issues with the production and that's why we helped the analysis team.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
#### Each value shows the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. 

### 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
#### No, the slope is not zero because there would be no correlation between mpg and independent variables.

### 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
#### It predicts mpg to an extent because the intercept could be less than or greater than zero. There could be different scalings or transformations to improve the predictions in the future.

### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
#### Yes it meets the specification because it does not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

* What metric or metrics are you going to test?
### I would test horsepower
* What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
### The null hypothesis would be that speed wouldn't have a factor to the horsepower.
* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
### I would race the two cars multiple time and go from there because I need data for the speed.
* What data is needed to run the statistical test?
### I need speed tests and how quick the car picks up.
